h1. Wordpress

WordPress is a free and open source blogging tool and a dynamic content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL

Recetas de Mam√° is using WordPress for publishing superb recipes at http://www.recetasdemama.es.

h2. Usage

In order to publish a WordPress site using this repositoriy you may execute:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/recetasdemama/wordpress.git
git submodule update --init
mkdir -p destination_path
git archive --format=tar HEAD | (cd destination_path && tar xf -)
git submodule foreach 'git archive --format=tar $sha1 | (cd destination_path/$path && tar xf -)'
</pre>

Next add your @wp-config.php@, create the proper MySQL table and set a web server.

Now you have to create the config file and add the @uploads@ folder to @wp-content@
  
<pre>
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
mkdir -p wp-content/uploads/
</pre>

h2. Multisite

There's a branch called 'multisite' for publishing several blogs with only one installation.

The main difference with the master branch should be the @.htaccess@ file.

If you're configuring a multisite environment you also need the @blogs.dir@ folder:

<pre>
mkdir -p wp-content/blogs.dir
</pre>
